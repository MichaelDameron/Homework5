# Homework5
Here is my basic Work Day Scheduler homework assignment. 

A user can enter their appointments/agendas in the text boxes for each hour between 9am-5pm (normanl work day hours). The user can click the save button to the side of the timeblocks, and what the user has entered is saved into local storage, and the colors green, red, or gray will appear, depending on what the time is from the moment (appears in header). Also, when the page is refreshed, the data the user has entered into the time blocks persists.
